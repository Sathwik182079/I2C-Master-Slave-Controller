# I2C-Master-Slave-Controller
RTL implementation of an I2C Master-Slave Controller in Verilog HDL featuring START/STOP generation, ACK/NACK handling, repeated START, multi-byte read/write transactions, open-drain SDA interface, and behavioral verification in Vivado.

# I2C Master-Slave Controller in Verilog HDL

## Overview

This project presents a complete RTL implementation of the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication protocol using Verilog HDL. The design includes both an I2C Master and an I2C Slave communicating through an open-drain bidirectional SDA bus with a generated SCL clock.

The controller supports multi-byte write and read transactions, repeated START conditions, ACK/NACK handling, and protocol verification using behavioral simulation in Xilinx Vivado.

## Protocol Flow

### Write Transaction

```
START
↓
Address + Write
↓
ACK
↓
Data Byte 1
↓
ACK
↓
Data Byte 2
↓
ACK
```

### Read Transaction

```
Repeated START
↓
Address + Read
↓
ACK
↓
Data Byte 1
↓
Master ACK
↓
Data Byte 2
↓
Master NACK
↓
STOP
```
